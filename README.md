# SnakesLaddersAnalysis
Third year physics project- using Python with matplotlib, numpy, scipy to analyse how Snakes and Ladders games behave with 2 different win conditions, and varying positions and numbers of snakes and/or ladders.

Win conditions:
- Post: this is the usual win condition for snakes and ladders, where the player doesn't need to roll the exact number of spaces to get to the finish, but that number or higher.
- Bounce: this is an alternate win condition where the player must roll the exact number of space remaining to get to the finish, and if they roll higher than that, they "bounce" back by the number of space that they rolled over the finish.

This project aimed to analyse how many turns it take on average for a player to win the game of Snakes and Ladders, while varying the win condition applied, the positioning of snakes and ladders on the board, and the number of snakes and ladders on the board. There is plenty of room for further investigation, e.g. varying number of sides on the die, applying other win conditions, rolling multiple die and taking the highest/lowest/sum score, different board dimensions, and so on and so forth. 

I have included my report in the repo for more information on the mathematics and the results of the investigation.
